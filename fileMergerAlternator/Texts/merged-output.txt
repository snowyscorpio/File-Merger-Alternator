My cat's names are Hatuli and Luna.
They make me smile every day.
They are quiet but always present.
Cats are gentle and calm creatures.
Even when they are resting, I enjoy being with them.
I love watching them stretch and yawn.
Sometimes, they just sit by the window.
They know how to comfort you when you feel down.
I find their independence fascinating.
Having cats around just makes things easier.
They always seem content with simple things.
